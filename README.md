# nse_history
A simple Python command line utility that takes in a single argument, a date (yyyy-mm-dd)
eg: ./pyscript 2014-09-29

1. The script should then download the *bhav.csv.zip from this page for the entered date - http://www.nseindia.com/products/content/equities/equities/archieve_eq.htm
2. Once it downloads, it extract the csv file inside the zip, count the number of lines, and print it on the console.
